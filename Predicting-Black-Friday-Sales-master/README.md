# Predicting-Black-Friday-Sales
 ## Problem Statement:
 ### A retail company wants to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories. They have shared purchase summary of various customers for a selected high volume products from last month. We need to build a model which will predict the purchase amount of the products. This is a regression problem.
